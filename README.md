👋 Hey there, I'm Rohith!
"Code is poetry. Data is the rhythm."

I'm a curious human who loves solving problems, building cool things with data, and occasionally breaking stuff just to learn how to fix it better. 😅

🧠 Data Analyst in the making, turning chaos into dashboards

🐍 Fluent in Python, SQL, and dad jokes

📊 Love working with Pandas, Power BI, and plots that tell stories

🤖 Also dabble in automation — bots > spreadsheets any day

🌱 Learning something new every single day (except maybe Sundays)

"If it can be automated, it will be." — probably me, after too much coffee

⚡ What you'll find here:
Mini projects that turned into obsessions

Code that’s messy before it’s beautiful

Experiments with data, dashboards, and scraping the web

Side quests like building job bots and designing cyberpunk portfolios
